          <p>
            Everywhere I look I see it. And it terrifies me.
            The flashes of crimson and blue feathers. The shine
            of that yellow beak. I wake up in the middle of the
            night in a puddle of sweat, trembling, fearing the
            next time I'll have to face it. Unable to clear my
            mind of the last encounter witht the beast. The ravenous
            claws ripping into my best friend, spilling his guts
            everywhere. Twas that fateful day that my innocence was
            stolen and my breakfast ruined. <br>
            It started how many of my days started. Sitting around with
            a bunch of my friends. I was next to my best friend Andy chatting
            about the political situation between Israel and Palestine
            when suddenly the monster appears. Attached to this odd monkey's
            chest, this large bird stands. Its presence dominates the room.
            I can only assume that the horrific bird was controlling the
            monkey's actions. This crimson and blue hawk commanded it's
            sapien underling to grab Andy. I tried to hold him down but
            my effort was futile. Andy was already hundreds of feet off of
            the ground. There was nothing I could do. I had to sit and watch
            as the monkey laid and strapped Andy to this massive white table,
            letting out a scream as a massive metal blade sunk through Andy's
            torso. Then the monkey proceeded to twist and pull Andy in half, laying
            one side of his body back onto the white table. In the other half
            was Andy's brain, and with a quick flick of the wrist, the metal
            blade was plunged right into his grey mater. As the blade was lifted
            the brain followed. And as if killing and removing the brain of my
            dear friend wasn't enough, the hawk then commanded to have Andy's
            body dismembered. Slivers of his flesh were layed upon a piece of warm
            toast, and all that was left could only be described as delicous.
