          Everywhere I look I see it. And it terrifies me.
          The flashes of crimson and blue feathers. The shine
          of that yellow beak. I wake up in the middle of the
          night in a puddle of sweat, trembling, fearing the
          next time I'll have to face it. Unable to clear my
          mind of the last encounter witht the beast. The ravenous
          claws ripping into my best friend, spilling his guts
          everywhere. Twas that fateful day that my innocence was
          stolen and my breakfast ruined. <br>
          It started how many of my days started. Sitting around with
          a bunch of my friends. I was next to my best friend Andy chatting
          about the political situation between Israel and Palestine
          when suddenly the monster appears. Attached to this odd monkey's
          chest, this large bird stands. Its presence dominates the room.
          I can only assume that the horrific bird was controlling the
          monkey's actions. This crimson and blue hawk commanded it's
          sapien underling to grab Andy. I tried to hold him down but
          my effort was futile. Andy was already hundreds of feet off of
          the ground. There was nothing I could do. I had to sit and watch
          as the monkey laid and strapped Andy to this massive white table,
          letting out a scream as a massive metal blade sunk through Andy's
          torso. Then the monkey proceeded to twist and pull Andy in half, laying
          one side of his body back onto the white table. In the other half
          was Andy's brain, and with a quick flick of the wrist, the metal
          blade was plunged right into his grey mater. As the blade was lifted
          the brain followed. And as if killing and removing the brain of my
          dear friend wasn't enough, the hawk then commanded to have Andy's
          body dismembered. Slivers of his flesh were layed upon a piece of warm
          toast, and all that was left could only be described as delicous. <br>
