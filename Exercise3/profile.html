      Everywhere I look I see it. And it terrifies me.
      The flashes of crimson and blue feathers. The shine
      of that yellow beak. I wake up in the middle of the
      night in a puddle of sweat, trembling, fearing the
      next time I'll have to face it. Unable to clear my
      mind of the last encounter witht the beast. The ravenous
      claws ripping into my best friend, spilling his guts
      everywhere. Twas that fateful day that my innocence was
      stolen and my breakfast ruined. <br>
      It started how many of my days started. Sitting around with
      a bunch of my friends. I was next to my best friend Andy chatting
      about the political situation between Israel and Palestine
      when suddenly the monster appears. Attached to this odd monkey's
      chest, this large bird stands. Its presence dominates the room.
      I can only assume that the horrific bird was controlling the
      monkey's actions. This crimson and blue hawk commanded it's
      sapien underling to grab Andy. I tried to hold him down but
      my effort was futile. Andy was already hundreds of feet off of
      the ground. There was nothing I could do. I had to sit and watch
      as the monkey laid and strapped Andy to this massive white table,
      letting out a scream as a massive metal blade sunk through Andy's
      torso. Then the monkey proceeded to twist and pull Andy in half, laying
      one side of his body back onto the white table. In the other half
      was Andy's brain, and with a quick flick of the wrist, the metal
      blade was plunged right into his grey mater. As the blade was lifted
      the brain followed. And as if killing and removing the brain of my
      dear friend wasn't enough, the hawk then commanded to have Andy's
      body dismembered. Slivers of his flesh was layed upon a piece of warm
      toast, and all that was left could only be described as delicous.
